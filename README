This small program retrives the every "interval" seconds the bytes send
over "interface" and breaks them down to a bytes per second basis. The
data is saved as a csv file.

Usage: :/program file interval interface
 - file:      File to save the data to.
 - interval:  Interval of data retrival in seconds.
 - interface: Network interface to retrive data from.

Beware: The program is FreeBSD specific.
